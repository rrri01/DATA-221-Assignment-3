Question 1:
This program uses the crime.csv, loads it into a dataframe, and calculates and prints the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum value, maximum value.

Question 2:
This program uses the crime.csv, and creates 2 plots, a histogram that shows how the crime rates are distributed. The box plot will also display the data about crime rates.

Question 3:
This program uses the kidney_disease.csv, creates a dataframe, and creates a feature matrix of all the features except for classification.
Then it creates a label vector y, with the classification column.
Then this program will train and test the model.

Question 4:
This program trains a k-nearest neighbors classifier using the same data as the previous program.
Then the model is trained and tested.
The accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score will be computed and then printed.

Question 5:
This program trains models where the k value is 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.
This program will also figure out which k value gives the highest test accuracy, and print that k value and the associated accurate.
